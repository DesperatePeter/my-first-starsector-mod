# Advanced Weapon Control - Starsector Mod

This is a basic utility mod, that allows you to set (auto-fire) weapon groups to PD-Only mode.
In PD-Only mode, weapons will ONLY fire at missiles and fighters, not at enemy ships.
This is especially useful for e.g. Bust PD Lasers, to not waste charges to deal soft-flux to enemy shields.

## Controls

Press ALT+#, where # is the Weapon Group Number on the NUMPAD to toggle between modes

## Roadmap

This is still a very early alpha version. The code is still very messy, and it has barely been tested yet!
First off I need to clean up a little and add version checker support and automatic releases.

In the future, I would like to improve the controls and maybe add dedicated missile/fighter only fire modes.

After that, I would like to add a feature where you can merge other weapon groups into your active weapon group.
